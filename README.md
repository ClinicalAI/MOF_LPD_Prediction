## A 3D deep learning approach to predict metalâ€“organic framework guest accessibility

Here, we introduce a method for predicting the guest accessibility of the MOFs using a 3D deep learning approach. We construct 3D voxels based on biophysical properties derived from the raw atom coordinates of metal-linker complex. We then fed these 3D voxels into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Using a comprehensive dataset of MOF structures acquired from two sources, we train and test the model. Our proposed model predicts the guest accessibility of MOF with high accuracy (R2 = 0.86). Our results demonstrate that 3D-CNNs can be used to predict MOF structural characteristics based on their 3D biophysical aspects.
